SELECT query with PDO

There are several ways to run a SELECT query using PDO, that differ mainly by the presence of parameters, type of parameters, and the result type. I will show examples for the every case so you can choose one that suits you best.

Just make sure you've got a properly configured PDO connection variable that needs in order to run SQL queries with PDO and to inform you of the possible errors.
